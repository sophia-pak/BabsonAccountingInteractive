# Dev reflection prompts:

## How did you interpret and implement someone else’s idea?

As the developer, I worked from the detailed PRD provided by the PM. The idea was to create an interactive and informative website that serves as a central resource for Babson accounting students. I broke the PRD into actionable components such as building an interactive timeline for concentration planning, setting up practice CPA questions, and integrating faculty contact cards. I made sure the navigation and page flow matched the PM’s intended user journey while also considering accessibility and responsiveness.

I did not struggle implementing the PM's ideas, as I tried to envision the website from a user's POV. I went in with an open mind and found that worked very well for me. 

## What were the challenges in development and collaboration?

One of the biggest challenges was connecting the contact form to an actual email inbox. Forms don’t automatically send emails unless a back-end service or integration is used, and setting that up took research and experimentation. 

Styling was another major pain point. I struggled with getting consistent spacing and alignment across screen sizes. Getting images to display nicely next to text or inside flip cards also took a lot of trial and error. I had to mess with flexbox, grid, and image sizing quite a bit. The toughest part was styling the faculty card's on the Faculty page. 

I did not have any challenges with collaboration, as I felt things went very smooth between the PM and Dev. 

## Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?

I used AI tools to help with both coding and debugging. For example, when I ran into problems with CSS alignment or responsive layout, I asked AI for suggestions or quick fixes. It also helped me troubleshoot why the email form wasn’t sending, and guided me through the setup for a third-party service. AI was also helpful in generating snippets of code for the interactive timeline and for logic around checking correct answers in the CPA practice quiz.

Overall, I learned that while development can look easy on paper, small technical and design issues can snowball. It taught me to be more patient with testing and layout design, and to always check how things behave on different devices.
